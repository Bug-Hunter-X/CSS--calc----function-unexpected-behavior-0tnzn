To avoid unexpected behavior with `calc()`, ensure consistent unit usage (e.g., all pixels or all percentages if relative sizes are desired) or use parentheses to explicitly control the order of operations. For example, if you need to subtract a percentage from a percentage, explicitly define the percentage values: `width: calc(100% - 50%);` or if you want to subtract a pixel value from a percentage, express them clearly: `width: calc(100% - 20px);`. Always double-check the results across various screen sizes and browser contexts.
