The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit handling.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` might not behave how you intend.  The calculation is performed with percentages relative to the containing element's size, potentially leading to inaccurate or unexpected dimensions.
